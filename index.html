    <p>This document describes a set of use cases motivating the development of
    WebRTC Next Version (WebRTC-NV).  Unlike WebRTC 1.0 API, WebRTC-NV will not
    utilize Session Description Protocol (SDP) in the API, nor will it mandate
    support for the Offer/Answer state machine.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>To motivate the development of WebRTC 1.0, the IETF RTCWEB WG developed [[RFC7478]].
    This document seeks to articulate use cases that will motivate the development of
    WebRTC-NV. The use cases described in this document fall into one of two categories:
    use cases already covered in [[RFC7478]] which could be enhanced within WebRTC-NV, and
    new use cases implementable within WebRTC-NV that are not possible within WebRTC 1.0.</p>.

    <h2>Existing Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Several use cases provide improvements to existing use cases described in [[RFC7478]].</p>
   <section id="multipartygame*">
      <h3>Multiparty online game with voice communications</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.3.12 describes a use case involving a multiparty online game with voice communications.
      In these scenarios, reducing join time is important. To minimize this, ICE enhancements are desirable, such as
      the ability to control candidate gathering and pruning.  Also, “parallel forking” minimizes conference
      establishment time by allowing a participant to broadcast an Offer to a “room” abstraction (maintained on a
      server), with other room participants responding back directly to the Offerer, avoiding a separate discovery step.
      Finally, the ability to support early media enables media to be received from responders before they answer the call.
      Also, the ability to impose a bandwidth limit across all mesh endpoints limits the build up of queues that can
      affect audio quality or perceived latency in the game.</p> 
      <p>Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p> 
      <pre class="requirement highlight">
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N01             The user agent can control candidate gathering and pruning, limiting the networks on l 
                       which candidates are gathered, the types of candidates, etc. 
   N02             The user agent must be able to support parallel forking, including reuse of locaICE 
                       candidates and local certificates with multiple Answerers.
   N03             The user agent must be able to impose a bandwidth limit across mesh endpoints.
   N04             Early media must be supported. 
      </pre>
<p>Experience: This use case has been implemented by a gaming service utilizing ORTC.</p>

      <h3>Mobility</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.3.6 describes a simple communications service where the user changes access network
      during the session.
      This use case is enhanced by being able to re-route media over an alternate path (potentially taking network cost
      into account) without need for signaling.</p>     
<pre class="example highlight">

      <h3>Video Conferencing with a Central Server</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.4.3.1 describes a use case involving Multiparty Video Communications with
      a central conferencing server. In such a use case, clients with disparate capabilities such as differing bandwidth availability,
      screen size and maximum displayable frame rate may participate in the same conference.
      In such a situation it is advantageous to support Scalable Video Coding (SVC).
      Encoding with temporal scalability is supported by several browsers today and is utilized by most
      centralized conferencing services.</p>
      <p>It is expected that spatial scalability (supported by VP9 and AV1) will become more popular with time.
      In this use case, if the desired video codec is known beforehand and participants are muted by default
      (as in a very large meeting), it is desirable to allow new participants to start receiving immediately,
      without negotiation. Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>
 <pre class="example highlight">
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N07             The user agent must be able to encode and decode video utilizing temporal scalability and 
                       (if supported by the chosen codec) spatial scalability.
   N08             A user agent can receive audio/video without a corresponding sender. 
   N09             It is possible to select the sending and/or receiving codec without negotiation.

<p>This use case has been implemented by conferencing services utilizing ORTC,
as well as proprietary additions to WebRTC 1.0.</p>

    <h2>New Use Cases</h2>

<section id="filesharing*">
<h3>File sharing</h3>
<p>Participants in a mesh exchange large files without disruption to audio/video sessions.
It is also possible for a participant to send a large file to a user who is not currently online.

 <pre class="example highlight">
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N10             It must be possible for the user agent to transfer large files as a single message without having to split
                       them up into small chunks. 
   N10.1          The application must be able to signal backpressure (flow control) when receiving data. It
                       must also receive a backpressure signal when sending data.
   N11             It must be possible for the user agent to transfer data utilizing a congestion control 
                       algorithm that does not compete aggressively with audio/video communications.
   N12             It must be possible for the file exchange to be supported by servers as well as user agents.
   N13             It must be possible to support data exchange in a service worker.

<h3>Virtual Reality Gaming</h3>

Secure Communications
An service that supports end-to-end confidentiality of communications in mesh and centralized conferencing scenarios.  Since the service provides the Javascript application as well as the backend services, both the SFU and the Javascript application are considered untrusted.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N22           The application needs to be able to enable end-to-end payload confidentiality and integrity 
                     protection.
   N23           The application must not be able to obtain access to e2e keying material.
   N24           TBD: restrictions on the application so as to prevent unauthorized recording of the
                     session and uploading to untrusted parties.  
Low Delay Media transmission
A sports broadcasting service enables users to view sporting events  (including 4K content) with low delay. So as to minimize storage, an advanced codec (such as AV1) is used that supports SVC with temporal and spatial scalability. Depending on network characteristics, custom approaches to reliability and robustness may be needed.

   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N25             The application needs to be able to control frame packetization.
   N26             Bandwidth estimates derived from the transport need to be fed back to
                       the encoder so as to enable adaptation of the sending rate.
   N27             The user agent must have control over the level of reliability of the transport as well as the 
                       jitter buffer. 
   N28             The user agent must have control over the level of robustness applied to various
                       SVC layers. 
   N29             The user agent must be able to deploy custom concealment, retransmission, 
                       redundancy and Forward error correction algorithms.
